# BellaBeat-Final-version-2016.
Overview
This project analyzes fitness band data to uncover trends and insights into activity levels, calorie burn, and daily movement patterns. The dataset provides detailed information on daily activity, including step counts, active minutes, sedentary time, and calories burned.

The analysis explores how activity intensity impacts calorie expenditure, examines patterns in daily activity, and identifies areas for health improvements.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle Dataset (Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16)
File Used: dailyActivity_merged.csv
Features:
TotalSteps: Total number of steps taken in a day.
SedentaryMinutes: Time spent in sedentary activities.
LightlyActiveMinutes: Time spent in light activities.
FairlyActiveMinutes: Time spent in moderate activities.
VeryActiveMinutes: Time spent in high-intensity activities.
Calories: Total calories burned in a day.
Key Findings
Correlation Between Steps and Calories:

Higher step counts result in increased calorie burn.
Very Active Minutes significantly enhance calorie expenditure compared to lower-intensity activities.
Average Steps Per Day:

Weekdays show consistent step counts, with Saturday seeing the highest activity levels.
Activity drops significantly on Sundays, indicating reduced movement during the weekend.
Activity Distribution:

81% of the time is spent in sedentary activities, which may include sleep or unmonitored periods.
Lightly active minutes account for 16%, while very active and fairly active minutes are minimal at 1% and 2%, respectively.
Calories Burned vs. Activity Levels:

Strong positive correlation between Very Active Minutes and calories burned.
Sedentary and lightly active minutes contribute minimally to calorie burn.
Caveat on Sedentary Time:

High sedentary percentages might include sleep time or device non-use. Adjusting for these factors would provide a clearer picture of true wakeful inactivity.
Visualizations
Key graphs included in the analysis:

Correlation Between Steps and Calories: Scatterplot showing the positive relationship.
Average Steps Per Day: Bar chart highlighting weekday vs. weekend activity patterns.
Percentage of Activity in Minutes: Pie chart illustrating the distribution of activity levels.
Calories vs. Activity Levels: Scatterplots showing correlations between calories burned and activity intensity.
Tools and Libraries
Python:
Pandas: For data cleaning and manipulation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Numpy: For numerical calculations.
Kaggle Notebook: For conducting the analysis.
Insights and Recommendations
Increase Active Minutes:

Encourage individuals to transition from sedentary to lightly active or fairly active levels.
Incorporate short bursts of very active exercises for maximum calorie burn.
Address Weekend Activity Drops:

Target Sundays with health-focused initiatives like family outings or leisure sports.
Personalized Activity Plans:

Highlight the importance of individual variability in calorie burn and activity patterns.
Use wearable devices for real-time feedback and motivation.
